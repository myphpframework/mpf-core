The text system base itself on the paths returned by the static object ENV for all i18n folders.

Example of use:
echo Text::byXml('filename')->get('id1');

The Text object will look for the nearest file name according to the ENV::paths()->i18n() paths.
It will then request the current session language, or default language, to open the filename in the
proper language.

The xml for each language is pretty straight forward, reference to the dtd http://myphpframework.com/dtd/i18n.dtd for more details.
