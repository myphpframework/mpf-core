The environment system consists of 1 main static object called "ENV" which is accessible from any scope.
This is the object you use when you want all possible paths that have a classes folder for this execution.

When a php script executes the object ENV crawls thru the directories up to the site's root
and identify all of the paths that have a folder named: classes,templates,i18n,css,images,config,includes.


This object is always the one that will ensure an enviroment is up and running or down.
It is the object that bootstraps the Template,Database and Session enviroment.
It makes sure the proper objects, configs etc... are loaded and ready calls
