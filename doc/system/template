The template system is based on the paths that the static object ENV returns for templates.
It will crawls to those directory to try to find the template you are looking for
and it will take the nearest template to its location. This gives us the opportunity to
override certain templates.

All template files must have the extension .phtml

Example:
Site_Root/
    index.php
    templates/
        layout.phtml
        header.phtml
        menu.phtml
        footer.html
    someSubFolder/
        templates/
            menu.phtml
        index.php
        add.php

In this example if load site_root/index.php it well have the menu /templates/menu.phtml
because it is the nearest to its location. But if we load /someSubFolder/index.php it
will have the menu /someSubFolder/templates/menu.phtml because its the nearest for that execution.

The template language is php and it is as of 2011-01-02 not monitorized, but in the futur all
the .phtml will be analyse to enforce a strict use of php within them in developpement mode.

template now has sorte of an error system. in the template bootstrap it highjacks the set_error_handler for all E_USER_*
and puts the errStr in the GLOBALS['userErrors'] so it can be rendered in a friendly template.
