The config system is xml based and pretty straight forward. The dtd (http://myphpframework.com/dtd/config.dtd) includes a simple example.

For the string type there is a marker that can be used to reference php constants or php variables.

Example:
   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!DOCTYPE config SYSTEM "http://myphpframework.com/dtd/config.dtd">
   <config>
      <value name="pathToSomething" type="string">/var/www/{PATH_TO_SITE_CONSTANT}/cache/</value>
      <value name="pathToSomething" type="string">/var/www/{$pathToSiteVariable}/cache/</value>
   </config>

The variable is put in the $GLOBALS context and thus must exist in the global scope to me referenced here.
